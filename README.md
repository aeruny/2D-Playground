# 2D-Playground

This project is a collection of mini projects that I worked on between August and October of 2020.
These are one of my first major programming projects.

It is built on Java Swing toolkit for graphics rendering. The IDE used for the project is intellij.
The projects in the Playground/Main/Object directory were inspired/guided by Coding Train videos on YouTube.

# How to run the program:
* This is a collection of mini projects, so there are multiple runnable classes across directories.
* jdk 14 *
1. Find a class that contains the main function.
2. Run the class.
3. Java Swing app will open. Some contains mouse control.



# Simple List of the Mini Projects
- Playground/Main/Object/FourierSeries: a simple fourier series represented by revolving pendulums and a linear graph
- Playground/Main/Object/LinearRegression: draws a linear regression line based on the points set on the canvas by mouse clicks
- Playground/Main/Object/Particles: particle generator with a gravity setting (collision is imcomplete)
- Playground/Main/Object/Matrix: 3D matrix rotation on a collection of points
- Playground/Main/Object/Pendulum: a simple pendulum movement with user control based on mouse drag speed
- Playground/Game/Snake: the famous Snake game (initially intended to be one of the collection of simple 2D games that I planned to make)
- Playground/AI: my first attempt at coding a neural network from scratch (Its algorithms were used for my actual AI project
- Playground/math and Playground/tools: these are my test classes and example codes from the Internet that I used as a reference for other projects


# What I learned from this 2D Playground project:
1. I became more proficient at using Java Swing and AWT.Canvas.
2. I got good exposure to the actionlistener interfaces from AWT.
3. I understood the difference between abstract class and interface in Java.
4. I learned the importance of creating objects efficiently.
5. I learned that coding gets frustrating but it feels really nice when the code works.
